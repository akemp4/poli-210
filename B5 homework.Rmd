Your assignment is to replicate, as best you can, each panel of Figure 1 (A, B, and, C) from the article:

LeVeck, B. L., Hughes, D. A., Fowler, J. H., Hafner-Burton, E. & Victor, D. G. The role of self-interest in elite bargaining. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 111, 18536â€“18541 (2014).

For each panel (A, B, and C), make a graph that is as close as possible to the graph shown in the paper.

After each graph, display the dataset used by the graph.

The core part of this assignment will be to calculate the standard errors, which are plotted as whiskers on top of the bar graphs (whiskers are 1 standard error of the mean in each direction). You can calculate the standard errors under the assumption that both elite and non-elite subject pools are random samples from their respective populations. To do this create a function called `sem`, which takes a variable and calculates the standard error of the mean, under the assumption that each observation is randomly, independently sampled from a broader population. I've started the code for you below.

Note, some of the standard errors in the actual paper are calculated using an estimation technique called the non-parametic bootstrap. We'll discuss this in a future class, but for now just know that your estimates may differ from the paper's by a little bit. 


```{r}
# takes a numeric vector and returns a standard error of the mean
sem <- function(x){
  if(!is.numeric(x)){
    "Error: x needs to be a numeric variable"
  }
  x_complete <- na.omit(x)
  n <- length(x_complete) # fill this in
  sd_hat <- sd(x_complete) # estimate standard deviation of the variable using the sd() function, or code your own.
  sem <- sd_hat/sqrt(n)# calcuate sem
  return(sem)    
}
```



Figure Replications

```{r}
sem(elitecsv$ult.min)
```

Figure 1
```{r}
Fig_1 <- elitecsv %>%
  group_by(elite)%>%
  summarize(
    mean_propose = mean(ult.propose, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_demand = mean(ult.min, na.rm = TRUE), 
    mean_patient = mean(patience, na.rm = TRUE),
    sem_propose = sem(ult.propose),
    sem_demand = sem(ult.min),
    sem_patient = sem(patience)
  )
```
Figure 1 C


```{r}
Fig_1_c <- elitecsv %>%
  group_by(elite, levelk) %>%
  summarise(
    n =n()
  )

Fig_1_c <- Fig_1_c %>%
  filter(!is.na(levelk))

Fig_1_c_2 <- aggregate(Fig_1_c$n, list(Fig_1_c$elite), FUN=sum)
Fig_1_c <- mutate(Fig_1_c, share = ifelse(elite==0, n/132*100,n/95*100))
Fig_1_c <- mutate(Fig_1_c, type= ifelse(elite==0, "Undergraduate","Elite"))
Fig_1_c
```

```{r}

head(Fig_1)

View(Fig_1)


Fig_1 <- mutate(Fig_1, type= ifelse(elite==0, "undergraduate", "elite"))

view(Fig_1)

ggplot(Fig_1) +
  geom_bar(aes(x= type, y= mean_propose, fill = type), stat = "identity", alpha=0.7) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=type, ymin=mean_propose-sem_propose, ymax= mean_propose+sem_propose), width=0.4, colour="black", alpha=0.9, linewidth=1.3)
```


Figure 2


```{r}
ggplot(Fig_1) +
  geom_bar(aes(x= type, y= mean_patient, fill = type), stat = "identity", alpha=0.7) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=type, ymin=mean_patient-sem_patient, ymax= mean_patient+sem_patient), width=0.4, colour="black", alpha=0.9, linewidth=1.3)





```




```{r}



figure_c <- ggplot(Fig_1_c, aes(x=levelk, y=share, fill=type)) + 
  geom_bar(position= "dodge", stat= "identity", alpha=0.7) 
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=type, ymin=mean_stratreason-sem_stratreason, ymax=mean_stratreason+sem_stratreason, width=0.4, colour="black", alpha=0.9, linewidth=1.3))

figure_c <- figure_c + labs(x="Level of Strategic Reasoning", y = "% of population")

figure_c

```
I will note that the error bars do not show, I understand that the error bars are coming from the standard error that is measured within code line 141, however I could not figure out how to find the level of strategic reasoning. I would have do the same code from Figure 1A but extend it in Firgure 1C. I was not able to come up with the code to figure this one out.






Next, create a test statistic as described in lecture and the notes. Test the null hypothesis that that the difference between elite and undergraduate MA0's is 0. Use an alpha 0.05. 

```{r}
elitecsv <- elitecsv %>%
  filter(!is.na(ult.min))
elitecsv
mean_elite <- mean(elitecsv$ult.min[elitecsv$elite==1])

mean_undergrad <- mean(elitecsv$ult.min[elitecsv$elite==0])
mean_undergrad
D_hat <- mean_elite-mean_undergrad ## insert difference in means estimator

elite_variance <- var(elitecsv$ult.min[elitecsv$ult.min==1])
elite_n <- sum(with(elitecsv, elite==1))

undergrad_variance <- var(elitecsv$ult.min[elitecsv$elite==0])
undergrad_n <- sum(with(elitecsv, elite==0))

se_D_hat <- sqrt(elite_variance/elite_n + undergrad_var/undergrad_n) ##  calculate standard error for difference in means estimator using notes / slides
test_statistic <- (D_hat - 0)/se_D_hat
test_statistic

alpha <- 0.05
qnorm(1-alpha/2) # use pnorm to analyze the test statistic under the null hypothesis as shown in the lecture slides
```


```{r}
elitecsv <- elitecsv %>%
  filter(!is.na(ult.min))
elitecsv
mean_elite <- mean(elitecsv$ult.min[elitecsv$elite==1])

mean_undergrad <- mean(elitecsv$ult.min[elitecsv$elite==0])
mean_undergrad
D_hat <- mean_elite-mean_undergrad ## insert difference in means estimator

elite_variance <- var(elitecsv$ult.min[elitecsv$ult.min==1])
elite_n <- sum(with(elitecsv, elite==1))

undergrad_variance <- var(elitecsv$ult.min[elitecsv$elite==0])
undergrad_n <- sum(with(elitecsv, elite==0))

se_D_hat <- sqrt(elite_variance/elite_n + undergrad_var/undergrad_n) ##  calculate standard error for difference in means estimator using notes / slides
test_statistic <- (D_hat - 0)/se_D_hat
test_statistic


alpha <-0
qnorm(1-alpha/2)

```

The null hypothesis will be rejected since there is no significant distance between elites and undergraduates.
